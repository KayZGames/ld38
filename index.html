<h2>Slimes in Panic</h2>
<div id="gamecontainer">
  <canvas id="game" width="1024px" height="768px"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="notes">
  <h3>Note: The game is incomplete. I wanted to add much more.</h3>
  <h4>Controls</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use left mouse button to execute actions</li>
    <li>Use right mouse button to navigate</li>
    <li>Use mouse wheel to zoom</li>
    <li>Left click on a free tile to build a building; bottem right of the tile needs to be a free space or a road; some
      buildings are only allowed on special terrain
    </li>
    <li>Left click on a tile with a road sign to start building a road</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Missing features:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Story: Game should have started with the spaceship intact, and someone causing a crash. After repairing the
      spaceship, the same thing happens but they end up on a smaller world. The game would end when the slimes arrive at
      a really small world, where you can't really build anything.
    </li>
    <li>Resource management - buildings cost resource, buildings produce resources and slimes move them from one
      crossroad to the next
    </li>
    <li>Breeding - 3 slimes would breed and produce offspring, color would change depending on parents colors with some
      mutations
    </li>
    <li>Roads should take the color of the slime, if it's used often</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Known bugs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Slimes can move from one road/building to another road, even if they aren't directly connected</li>
    <li>2 crossroads can be connected using multiple roads, slimes will only occupy the shortest road</li>
    <li>building something next to a road will add a road sign, but the separated roads don't get recognized by the
      slimes
    </li>
  </ul>
